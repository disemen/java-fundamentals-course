Lear functional programming by refactoring a piece of code using Stream API 💪

### Task
`SumOfSquares` is a class that allows you to calculate a sum of squares in a provided range. It is implemented using 
 OO approach. Your job is to **refactor the todo section using functional approach.** So the **implementation will not use 
 mutable variables**, and all test will pass.
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with Java 8

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start working on the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the branch **exercise/completed** and see the final implementation

Build strong skill of creating and linking **nodes – building blocks** that are used in order to create **LinkedList**, **LinkedQueue** and other
important data structures 💪

### Pre-conditions ❗
You're supposed to be familiar **Java classes** and **generics**

### Objectives
* implement a generic class `Node<T>` ✅
* **link** two node objects ✅
* create a **list of linked nodes** ✅
* create a **circle of linked nodes** ✅
